Project title= Covid_toy
Introduction :
This is a symtoms-based predictive model was proposed to predict COVID-19 based on the symtoms.
Project prosses.
we created a project in which rules were created and used as input.
then this data were used as raw data.Then feature selection took place as a part of proccecing data.The data were divided into training data(80%)and test(20%),usually know as train test split procces.Training data were used to train ML classifier that we used in the model,and test data were used to test that classifier in terms of accuracy recevied over a predefined  unseen portion.
Conclusion
The model gives results on the basis data developed by information given by health agencies.Thus, forecasting may not be 100% accurate, but it can surely be used as a corrective measure.For future work further enhancement can be done by combining new factors and algorithms to get more accurate results.
